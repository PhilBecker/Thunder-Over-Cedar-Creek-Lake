                  <p>On ------,, four board members of the <strong>Cedar  Creek Veterans Foundation (CCVF)</strong> attended a meeting with the founders and leadership group at The Fisher    House in Dallas, Texas. The Foundation was represented by Patty Evans, President, and Board Members Jennifer Ball, Garrett Engle and Phil Becker.  Also present for the  luncheon were the founders General    Robert Carey and Dick Agnew, staff members Lydia Henderson (Director of  Fisher House)    and doctors and staff from the Veterans Hospital. The Cedar Creek     Veterans Foundation presented a check of $12,000 to Lydia Henderson; this means that the Foundation has presented to this wonderful organization over $72,000 in the past five years.  </p>
                  <p>  <br>
                    One of the most benificial organizations that is supported by the CCVF is the <strong>Fisher House</strong>,     located next door to the Veterans Hospital in Dallas Texas. In order    to use the  Fisher House, you have to be a veteran and your residence must be more than 60 miles from the  hospital.   The Fisher House  provides a safe, convenient and comfortable place for our East Texas  veterans,   serving military and their  families as they receive  treatment.   Fisher   House opened its doors in 2009 and has provided  housing for 1,583    families, 17 active duty families, 17 combat war  veterans, 291 seniors,   1048  adults and 114 children with an average  stay of 8 days. Many of   these families  would have been unable to  afford to be with their loved   ones as they recovered  from wounds or  received treatment before the   Fisher House was built. The funds that were presented will be used to supply food,  linens, travel money and many other    services that enhance the ability of the Fisher  House to provide a home    away from home for the families of our nation&rsquo;s  hospitalized heroes. It is the  goal  of the Fisher House Trust to   have a Fisher House located at every  veterans  and military hospital in   the United States. </p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>The Cedar Creek Veterans  Foundation was established in  2009 by some residents of the Pinnacle Club in  Mabank, Texas on Cedar Creek   Lake to raise money for  well-established non-profits providing support  services to military and  veterans and their families particularly those  from East Texas who were injured  in combat operations in Afghanistan   and Iraq.  The signature event of the Foundation is the <strong><em>Thunder  Over Cedar Creek Lake Air Show</em></strong> over 4th of July weekend  which was viewed by over 50,000 people.   The  air show was started several years ago by Board member and MiG-17   owner and pilot Randy Ball and is one of very few shows performed over   water.  In addition to the MiG–17, prior  shows have featured an Air Force F-16  demonstration team, C–17, the Tora Tora Tora group,  C–130,  an L-29,  a B-52 bomber, three of  only about a dozen B-25&rsquo;s still flying and many  others.  </p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>The<strong> Director of the Air Show is Randy Ball</strong>, a 6th generation Texan and the grand son of a World War II B-17 bomber pilot. Randy has over 30 years as a pilot and still works as an Airline Captain. With over 24 years of experience in air shows, he has flown in over 1,000 performances. His 1,000 hours of time piloting a Russian Jet Fighter has been recognized as he has a Level I Jet Aerobatic Day and Night rating; the <u>ONLY JET FIGHTER PILOT IN NORTH AMERICA</u>. As Director, Randy works to get the performers sequenced in the Air Show to provide the thrills and excitement that has been the corner stones of this event since the beginning </p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>During 2015, the <strong>Cedar Creek Veterans Foundation</strong> will once again have three events to support the three Armed Forces Veterans charity organizations that the proceeds are distributed to; the <strong>The Fisher House, Hope for the Warriors</strong>,  and the <strong>Navy and Marine Corp Relief Society. </strong>In addition, the <strong>Foundation</strong> will also provide financial support to the Payne Spring Fire Rescue for their stand-by emergency services during the Air Show. Since the initial Air Show, the Foundation has provided almost $100,000 to these organizations to provide for Veterans and their familes.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p><u>The first event </u>will be the <strong>Cedar Creek Veterans  Foundation Golf Classic. </strong>This will be conducted at the Pinnacle Golf Club in Payne Springs on <strong>Monday June 8, 2015</strong>.     The profits from the tournament will benefit all three charities and    will give  the towns, local businesses and communities a chance to    support our veterans  and troops. We are very honored that George P. Bush will be attending our Classic. Come out and support our special    guests, several soldiers from Brooke Army  Medical Center who are recovering or    who have recovered from injuries received  in the service to their    country.  We&rsquo;ll  be honoring local veterans and military for their    service to our country. <strong>You  can contact Gayle Robinson at 903- 451-5054 if you are interested in playing in  the golf tournament or becoming a sponsor.</strong></p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p><u>The second event</u> will be the Cedar Creek Veterans Foundation Pilot's Party, to be held on Friday, July 3, 2015.  This social hour and dinner is held to have our performers available for interaction with residents and supporters of the CCVF. There will be opportunities to have photographs taken with the pilots and their supporting teams as well as special entertainment focus on the activities of the third event.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p><u>Our annual Air Show, &ldquo; <strong>Thunder Over Cedar Creek Lake</strong>&rdquo;, is the third event</u> that will be held on Saturday July 4th, 2015. We expect to have an     even more exciting Air Show than last year. Most of the pilots who fly    in our  show donate their fees in order for us to provide  more money for    the military  charities we support. We&rsquo;ve spent a great deal of    time making sure that the  money we donate gets to the people it&rsquo;s    intended to benefit. <strong>Randy Ball</strong>, who is the Air Show founder and pilots our premier military aircraft, a MiG 17 fighter, works very hard to make this a thrilling, dynamic event for  the Cedar Creek Lake area. He is shown in the flight suit in the group photograph above. We are now the <strong>4th largest air show</strong> in the southwest and the only one over water! If you are interested in <strong>helping</strong> or being a <strong>sponsor</strong> you can contact <strong>Gayle Robinson</strong> 903-451-5054 or <strong>Patty Evans</strong> 903-451-1020.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
