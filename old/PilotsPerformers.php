              <p>The C-60 was originally designed as an airliner in the late 1930’s. Capable of flying higher, further and faster than its competitor the DC-3, it was an obvious choice for impressment by the military with the outbreak of war. It performed a number of highly specialized tasks during the war, including the evacuation of troops from the Philippines, training of paratroopers and glider crews, executive transport and even the delivery of allied secret agents into Northern Europe.<br />

              <p>When  introduced in 1939, the Corsair represented a major leap forward in technology.  When it made its debut, it was the fastest combat aircraft in the world! Its  most distinctive feature is the Corsair’s inverted-gull wings, necessary to  provide propeller ground clearance without an excessively lengthy and fragile  landing gear. It was the first aircraft to utilize the Pratt and Whitney R2800  engine, thus the requirement of the huge 1200 pound Hamilton Standard propeller  to convert the 2400 horsepower provided into thrust. The “Dash-One” variant is  the sleekest and best flying of all Corsair types and in an independent survey  conducted by the Army, it was judged to be the best all-around propeller driven  fighter of World War Two! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-D_ZKjEjZ8&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">View Video</a></p>

Designed by North American Aviation, the T-6 is known by a variety of designations depending on the model and operating air force. The USAAC designated it as the AT-6, the United States Navy the SNJ, and British Commonwealth air forces, the Harvard, the name it is best known by outside of the US. It remains a popular warbird aircraft. <br />

              <p>Jack first jumped in 1969 while he was training as   an Army helicopter aviator.  He did not like the landings so he decided   he would just fly rather than jump out of a perfectly good flying   aircraft.  Then in 1984 while flying some  skydivers a premature   parachute deployment damaged the aircraft.  Jack landed the aircraft   but, after inspecting the damage,  realized he should have jumped out.    Jack just got lucky that the tail did not fall off during his descent   and landing.  That week Jack decided that he needed to review how to   exit a plane and land with a parachute.  During the jump,  Jack learned   that the new square parachute was  just another airfoil he could fly.    So now he jumps out of aircraft as much as he fly’s aircraft. The flag   jumper today is JACK  PYLAND who has more than 9,200 jumps.  He actively   jumps around north Texas as a Tandem instructor taking people for their   first jump.  He is also a USPA Static line and Coach Instructor   examiner.</p>
              <p>Jack jumps at several  Air   Shows opening the show with a giant American Flag. The flag is 37ft tall   and 57ft long ( more than 2100 Square Feet). He has delivered the   ceremonial game ball into several football events like the Cotton Bowl.   Jack is a Santa helper that jumps in at the opening event of Christmas   in the Square in Frisco Texas.</p>
              <p>Today   Jack Pyland will be exiting around 4500 feet  above the ground.   After   deploying the parachute and verifying that the parachute is open   correctly he will then deploy the Flag.   </p>
