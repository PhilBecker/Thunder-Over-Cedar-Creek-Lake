        	<p><img src="assets/layout/home_01.jpg" width="250" height="172" align="right" class="contentimg" />Thunder Over Cedar Creek Lake is a spectacular air show that will entertain and amaze you with aerial acrobatics and an up-close-and-personal experience with the power of a jet fighter. You’ll see an amazing array of both civilian and military aircraft, ending with a rain of fire over the lake from the spectacular fireworks show.</p>
<p><img src="assets/layout/home_02.jpg" align="left" class="contentimg" /></p>
<p>Last year’s show drew 40,000 people, and with even more aircraft and performers, this year’s show will be even better!</p>
            <p>The 2010 Thunder Over Cedar Creek Lake Air Show will honor past and present military personnel and proceeds will benefit military charities.</p>
