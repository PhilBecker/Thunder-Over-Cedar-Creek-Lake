<p>PRESS RELEASE              </p>
              <p>The Cedar Creek Veterans  Foundation presented a check for $4,000 to Sharon Zacharias, Director of the  Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society, and Captain T.D. Smyers, Base Commander, at  the Naval Air Station - Joint Reserve Base in Fort Worth on November 29th.  The donation is the first given to the  non-profit by the Foundation and represents a part of the proceeds from the <strong><em>Thunder  Over Cedar Creek Lake Air Show</em></strong> held on July 3rd and other  fundraising events during 2010.  The Navy-Marine  Corps Relief Society is a more than 100 year old private non-profit which  supports unmet needs of military and veterans of those services and their  eligible family members and survivors.    In addition to assistance with medical needs such as its Combat Casualty  Assistance Visiting Nurse Program, the Society provides financial and  educational resources including loans and counseling to enable the Navy and  Marine Corps families to achieve financial self-sufficiency and to meet  emergency needs.  The Society enjoys  significant assistance from military commanders and other military personnel  and offices are generally located at Navy or Marine Corps facilities such as  the Naval Air Station - Joint Reserve Base in Fort Worth.</p>
              <p>Bob O’Neil President of the  Cedar Creek Veterans Foundation said, “We are thrilled that our volunteer  efforts are able to make a significant contribution to such a worthwhile cause  and very grateful to all of our supporters especially our fellow residents and  the management of the Pinnacle Club.”   Joining Bob at the presentation were Randy Ball, Karen Boyd, Patty  Evans, Mark Fankhauser, Gary Freer, Gayle Robinson and Linda Thompson, some of  the officers and board members of the Foundation.  </p>
              <p>The Cedar Creek Veterans  Foundation was established in 2009 by some residents of the Pinnacle Club in  Mabank on Cedar Creek  Lake to raise money for  well-established non-profits providing support services to military and  veterans and their families particularly those from East Texas who were injured  in combat operations in Afghanistan  and Iraq.  The signature event of the Foundation is the <strong><em>Thunder  Over Cedar Creek Lake Air Show</em></strong> over 4th of July weekend  which was viewed by over 50,000 people.   The air show was started several years ago by Board member and MiG-17  owner and pilot Randy Ball and is one of very few shows performed over  water.  In addition to the MiG–17, prior  shows have featured an F-16 demonstration team, C–17, the Tora Tora Tora group,  C–130,  an L-29, B-52 bomber, three of  only about a dozen B-25’s still flying and many others.  Although the Foundation relies primarily on  donations, last spring it also held a fundraising gala dinner and dance, “From  Texas to Tinseltown,” and a golf tournament with celebrity guest actor Jae  Head, who played SJ Tuohy in the movie “The Blind Side.” </p>
              <p>The 2011 <strong><em>Thunder Over Cedar Creek Lake Air  Show</em></strong> will be held on Saturday, July 2, 2011 starting at 6 pm and a  benefit golf tournament will take place at Pinnacle Club on Monday, May 23,  2011.  For more information or to donate  contact Bob O’Neil, CCVF President, at 903-681-4546 or go to the CCVF website  at <a href="http://www.ccveteransfoundation.org">www.ccveteransfoundation.org</a> or <a href="http://www.tocclairshow.com">www.tocclairshow.com</a> .  The CCVF is  a 501(c)(3) organization.</p></td>
