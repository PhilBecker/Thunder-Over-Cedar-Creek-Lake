              <p>PRESS RELEASE—12/30/2012          </p>
              <p>On Dec. 20th, four board members of the <strong>Cedar  Creek Veterans Foundation (CCVF)</strong> attended a Christmas luncheon with  families staying at The Fisher   House in Dallas, Texas. Also present for the  luncheon were General   Robert Carey, Dick Agnew, Lydia Henderson (Director of  Fisher House)   and doctors and staff from the Veterans Hospital. The Cedar Creek    Veterans Foundation presented a check of $15,000 to Lydia Henderson.    These funds will be used to supply food,  linens, gas and many other   services that enhance the ability of the Fisher  House to provide a home   away from home for the families of our nation&rsquo;s  hospitalized heroes. </p>
              <p>The CCVF exists to raise funds for charities that support  our military personnel.  <br />
                One of the organizations supported is the <strong>Fisher House</strong>,    located next door to the Veterans Hospital in Dallas Texas. In order   to use the  Fisher House, you have to live 60 miles from the hospital.   The Fisher House  provides a safe place for our East Texas veterans,   serving military and their  families as they receive treatment.   Fisher   House opened its doors in 2009 and has provided housing for 1,583    families, 17 active duty families, 17 combat war veterans, 291 seniors,   1048  adults and 114 children with an average stay of 8 days. Many of   these families  would have been unable to afford to be with their loved   ones as they recovered  from wounds or received treatment before the   Fisher House was built. It is the  goal of the Fisher House Trust to   have a Fisher House located at every veterans  and military hospital in   the United States. </p>
              <p>This year the <strong>Cedar Creek Veterans Foundation</strong> will once again have three events to support <strong>The Fisher House, Hope for the Warriors</strong>,  and the <strong>Navy and Marine Corp Relief Society. </strong></p>
              <p>The first event will be the <strong>Cedar Creek Veterans  Foundation Golf Classic</strong> at Pinnacle Golf Club on <strong>Monday May 6, 2013</strong>.    The profits from the tournament will benefit all three charities and   will give  the towns, local businesses and communities a chance to   support our veterans  and troops. Come out and support our special   guests, soldiers from Brooke Army  Medical Center who are recovering or   who have recovered from injuries received  in the service to their   country.  We&rsquo;ll  be honoring local veterans and military for their   service to our country. <strong>You  can contact Gayle Robinson at 903- 451-5054 if you are interested in playing in  the golf tournament or becoming a sponsor.</strong></p>
              <p>Our annual Air Show &ldquo; <strong>Thunder Over Cedar Creek Lake</strong>&rdquo;    will be held on Saturday July 6th, this year. We expect to have an    even more exciting Air Show than last year. Most of the pilots who fly   in our  show donate their fees in order for us to make more money for   the military  charities we support. We&rsquo;ve spent a great deal of   time making sure that the  money we donate gets to the people it&rsquo;s   intended to benefit. <strong>Randy Ball</strong> who is the Air Show founder works very hard to make this a thrilling event for  the Cedar Creek Lake area. We are now the <strong>5th largest air show</strong> in the southwest and the only one over water. If you are interested in <strong>helping</strong> or being a <strong>sponsor</strong> you can contact <strong>Gayle Robinson</strong> 903-451-5054 or <strong>Patty Evans</strong> 903-451-1020.</p>
              <p>Over 47,000 men and women have been wounded since 2001. A  lot   of them will need continuing medical treatment throughout their life.   The  Cedar Creek Veterans Foundation is dedicated to helping make these   soldiers and  their family&rsquo;s lives a little easier.  If  you would like   to help, you can go to <strong>ccveteransfoundation.org</strong> and make an on line  donation. <strong>Cedar Creek Veterans Foundation is a 501(C) (3) charity with an A+  rating</strong>. </p></td>
