It is now the main tactical airlifter for many military forces worldwide. Over 40 models and variants of the Hercules serve with more than 60 nations.

While out classed by the Japanese Zero, the Warhawk held its own in dog-fights due to the durable nature of the airframe and the skill of the pilots. It was used  by the air forces of 28 nations, including those of most Allied powers  during World War II, and remained in front line service until the end of  the war. The Flying Tigers used this aircraft exclusively prior to the United States declaring war on Japan.<br>

This aircraft was used to train pilots for active duty during the past 50+ years. The two-member crew capabilty and stable airframe was a forgiving platform for getting student pilots ready for the fighter aircraft. The precision of the Trojan Phlers is a sight to behold and makes us proud of the training of our Warriors of The Air. She has earned a well deserved retirement from   active  military service.<br>

                <h6>T-28/Trojan Phylers-Chip Lamb & John<br><br> Sledge</h6>
                <br>
                <p>These aircraft were used to teach Navy and Marine aviators basic  transition, formation, aerobatics and instrument procedures and  techniques. The T-28 can outperform most World War II fighters at low  altitude. These three aircraft are owned and operated by Trojan Players,  Inc.<br>

                <p>Matt Cessna's T-37 serves as a trainer around the globe for two-person crews. This unassuming aircraft is used through the armed forces world wide for training of student pilots. While not necessarily designed for stunts or aerobatic flight, Eric is very eager to show case this aircraft for us in the Air Show.<br>

                  <p>Matt Younkin&rsquo;s Beech 18 performance is likely the   most  unusual act on  the airshow circuit today.   The Beech 18 was never   designed for  aerobatic flight; however that  doesn't make it incapable   of doing  just that.<br>
