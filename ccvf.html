              </div><div class="text_2">
                <p>The Cedar Creek Veterans  Foundation was established in  2009 by some residents of the Pinnacle Club in  Mabank, Texas on Cedar Creek   Lake to raise money for  well-established non-profits providing support  services to military and  veterans and their families particularly those  from East Texas who were injured  in combat operations in Afghanistan   and Iraq.  The signature event of the Foundation is the <strong><em>Thunder  Over Cedar Creek Lake Air Show</em></strong> over 4th of July weekend  which was viewed by over 50,000 people.   The  air show was started several years ago by Board member and MiG-17   owner and pilot Randy Ball and is one of very few shows performed over   water.  In addition to the MiG–17, prior  shows have featured an Air Force F-16  demonstration team, C–17, the Tora Tora Tora group,  C–130,  an L-29,  a B-52 bomber, three of  only about a dozen B-25&rsquo;s still flying and many  others.  </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>The<strong> Director of the Air Show is Randy Ball</strong>, a 6th generation Texan and the grand son of a World War II B-17 bomber pilot. Randy has over 30 years as a pilot and still works as an Airline Captain. With over 24 years of experience in air shows, he has flown in over 1,000 performances. His 1,000 hours of time piloting a Russian Jet Fighter has been recognized as he has a Level I Jet Aerobatic Day and Night rating; the <u>ONLY JET FIGHTER PILOT IN NORTH AMERICA</u>. As Director, Randy works to get the performers sequenced in the Air Show to provide the thrills and excitement that has been the corner stones of this event since the beginning </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>During 2015, the <strong>Cedar Creek Veterans Foundation</strong> will once again have three events to support the three Armed Forces Veterans charity organizations that the proceeds are distributed to; the <strong>The Fisher House, Hope for the Warriors</strong>,  and the <strong>Navy and Marine Corp Relief Society. </strong>In addition, the <strong>Foundation</strong> will also provide financial support to the Payne Spring Fire Rescue for their stand-by emergency services during the Air Show. Since the initial Air Show, the Foundation has provided almost $100,000 to these organizations to provide for Veterans and their familes.</p><br>
